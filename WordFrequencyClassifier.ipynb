We never preached in favour of exterminating half the population; we never inculcated the necessity of consigning any class or portion of the population, nor any indi- vidual of the population, to the knife, or a la lan- terne. On the contrary, we abhor violence of every description. we have ever abhorred it; we have iever repudiated and denounced it in the strongest language we could use; and it is only because this caitiff knows that we abhor and denounce it, that he now.maligns us. The very passage. in \" THE - OPERATIVE\" upon which he bases his misrepre. sentations, proves the abhorrence in which we hold physical force, except as a means of self-preserva- tion ; in which case the use of it is sanctified by every law human and divine. To show the wretch that wel have preached nothing of which we are f ashamed, or that we fear to preach again, when e called upon, we shall take the liberty of reprinting here the very identical words which have served him for a text, and of which so foul an advantage If has been taken to calumniate us all over the country during the last three weeks. a (From \" THE OPERATIVE\" of March 17.) \"There is no use in mincing matters. The landlords e and capitalists of this country, including the profit-monger I- on the Inod, as well as the profit-monger of the factory, 0 must either concede the rights of the people. or they n must be exterminated. Twenty millions of people were I. not made to be either slaves or playthings for these mur- Xs derers. If tie landlord opposes armed force to the rights ie of the people, the landlord must be put to death. If the or Capitalist opposes armed force to the rights of the people, ;f the capitalist must be put to death. If the farmer, or any other description of profit-monger, opposes armed force is to the rights of the people, the farmer or profit-monger - must be put to death. it What is there in this passage, you base libeller, it that can justify your atrocious misrepresentations? , What is there in it that can warrant you in assert- ing that \" the Editor of 'THE OPERATIVE' calls D, for the exterrination of half of the population 9\" re Is it preaching extermination, to preach against Id men who employ armed force to enslave one por- al tion of their fellow-creatures, and to consign the itremainder to premature graves ? What right have the landlords and profit-mongers of this country of (even supposing them, with you, to constitute one- ;h half the population; which they do not) to use a Df Musket or a bayonet against me for simply doing l an act which they do themselves, namely, electing a representative to protect my interests-what Is right, I say, have they to shoot or bayonet me for re such act, more than I have to shoot or bayonet them for the like act ? Had the words in the above extract been applied to all landlords and profit- mongers, there would have been some excuse for to Your outrageous libel, but they were applied only se to such landlords and capitalists as would murder t- working men for electing members of parliament le in the same way that landlords and profit-mongers ar elect the members of the present corrupt House of n Commons. The unrepresented classes do not at- le tempt to kill or to employ armed force against in the present electoral body for making a parliament ie without their consent. Why should that electoral in body attempt to kill or employ armed force against e, the unrepresented for performing a similar act? e, Now, they either mean to do so, or they do not. of If they do not mean to employ armed force against ie 's, they have nothing to fear from us, and you, of Dn the \" Free Press,\" are as false to them as you are to us. But if, as you insinuate, they do mean to lit employ it, then do you declare them to be wilful ., murderers, prepared to destroy us the moment we ea attempt to become free, and you leave us, the un- ,, represented, but one alternative-either to live and s' die slaves, or to repel murder by justifiable homi- tf cide. Hoow will you get over this, you base it hireling? If, when you penned your libel, you Ln believed that the landlords and profit-mongers will no not employ armed force against us, you must have )nm known that our words \"put to death\" could 'not ror possibly apply to them, and therefore you are a D- wilful calumniator. If, on the contrary, you did ile believe that they will or would employ armed force er againstus, then I know no language capable of de- ira scribing your baseness; for, with such a belief, it tes was the landlords and capitalists you ought to have et, denounced as would-be exterminators, and not the ch Editor of \" THE OPERATIVE,\" who showed his rs, abhorrence of physical force, by menacing all who Ice should resort to it, with national justice. There, or. men' of Bolton, is a dilemma from the horns of Itet which we defy the unprincipled hack of the \" Free iw Press\" to escape, es; \" Mr. O'Brien,\" he says, \" talks of the farmer on and shopkeeper as men more worthy of being put to death than burglars or highWaymen \"I This is he another infamous falsehood. ' Mr. O'Brien's lan- all guage applies only to such farmers and shopkeepers ice as would employ or sanction armed force to prevent the emancipation of the unrepresented classes. Its, Such farmers and shopkeepers, be has no hesitation of in saying, are many times worse than burglars or no highwaymen'; and were.they to kill any portion of ld the working classes while in the peaceable pursuit ast of their rights, they would be infinitely greater cri- minals than any description of felon or murderer ect known to our present laws. To rob a man of his Ise purse, or even of his whole property, is but to rob to hiln of a casual and temporary possession, which hb try eier recover through the laws, or the loss o' ted which he may afterwards make up for by futus soidustry.

[E At last this brave and indefatigable friend of al 411 the people is about to suffer for the incalculable services he has rendered his country. It will be C seen by our legal intelligence, that a criminal infor- er mnation has been filed against him by the Attorney- h s0 se General, for an alleged libel on the guardians of b ZG the poor of the Union of Warminster, in Wiltshire. c a It is a most paltry, cowardly proceeding. It is an le attempt, under pretence of vindicating the charac- 'ly ters of a few worthless creatures, to do what the a id government has long wished, but had not the man- c liness to do on its own responsibility-namely, to o victimise the man who, under Providence, has been re the main instrument of their approaching downfall. D Feargus O'Connor has done more for the liberties d _ of Britain than was ever before done by any one c ie private individual for the liberties of any other c Is country, antient or modern, in the same period of t E- time. In this lies the secret of the information 1 against him-the whole \"head and front of his t htoffending.\" Had he not been the prime mover- the alpha and omega, as it were, of the present b glorious movement, he might have published what .she liked, about Warminster or any other Union, i with impunity. The Attorhey-General, in moving for the rule, S talked of the mis-statements in the s Star,\" and i4- of the necessity of protecting character. But were ck that the sole object intended, the parties would l of have proceeded by action, and not by a criminal t information. In an action for libel the defendant _ is allowed to prove the truth of his published state. ments. No such liberty is allowed him in an in- he formation. Neither truth nor the vindication of K character can 'therefore have anything to do with I Ir. the present proceeding. In truth, men capable of Ar accepting guardianships of the poor, under the id, existing system, can have no characters worth e; protecting. &. Were it possible to add to Feargus O'Connor's I- popularity, this new Whig manceuvre will have E _ that effect. l nd SHAH-RADICAL RASCALITY. 4r. A country correspondent calls our attention to in a slanderous article published in the \" Bolton Free I n Press\"-an obscure northern print, of whose exist- meence we had no previous knowledge. The article ghin question is an editorial commentary on our an address to the working classes, which appeared on l l the 17th of last month, and which gained us the I o0 honour of a vote of' thanks from the Bolton Its Ice Worling Men's Association. Whether it was the at, address itself, or the vote of thanks given to us in edconsequence, that excited our contemporary's bile, l nd we know not; but whatever the exciting cause, .ch we challenge the \" Free Press\" to furnish out of red the' annals of literary rascality a parallel to the tce following tissue of outrageous calumny and brazen I k falsehoods:- n- his is a fair specimen of the insane doctrines, taught re, by MaratO'Brien, in bis journal called \"TnzOPERATIVN.. re't The real Marat, Mr. O'Brien's precursor, during the heat ts of the French Revolution, in his paper called Ami da Ms Peuple, demanded the \" heads of 260,000 aristwcrats.\" eel The editor of \" TuE OPERATIVE,\" is not content with so to small a niumber: he calls for the exterrninetion of half sw the population. All profit-mongerrs must be - put to ,ble death,\" unless the rights of the people are conceded. It est would, perhaps, be as well were Mr. O'Brien to ascertain his what proportion these \" odious profit.mongers\" bear to the td working-men of Great Britain, before lie consigns them to of the knife, or la lanterne. In justice to the delegate from eir Leigh, we incline to believe, that his sympathy for au. the working classes has had an injurious effect on his in- &ttellect. No sane person, no man who wishes the people his to obtain Universal Suffrage, would ever use such Ian. r; guage. Mr. O'Brien talks of the farmer and shopkeeper ebt, as men more worthy of being put to death than burglars se. or highwaymen. He talks as if Universal Suffrage would Ieir instantly annihilate all these classes whom lie denominates ery ' profit-mongers ;\" but all the white he chooses to forget, the that even in Republican America, the proportion which rpo the farmers, the shopkeepers, and all other profit-mongers, ied bear to the working men, is at least as great as it is in the this country. Mr. O'Brien is one of those who denounce and taking interest on money, as downrightrobbery of the poor. lht Does lie not know, that in Republican America, the rate eerof interest is eight or nine per cent., while in England it is not more than four per cent? Does he not also know, that in whatever manufacturing nation the rate of interest n is high, the wages of working men are high also ?-i oitea arFree Prcssal. -g t ree Thi extract affords a striking illustration of the e ort of artillery by which the Wise and good of all J. ages have been immolated at the shrine of avarice O.'s and usurpation. Unable to refute our arguments, FAn and not daring to contravene our statements of fce, facts the base editor of the \" Free Press\" has no Mr. ' eet. other weapon to employ against us, than the old seet: hackneyed ones of calumny and falsehood.

Mr. STEPHENS. - 1. We, the undersigned, members of the sbove Committee, in pursuence of tbe resolutiona passed at the aforesaid meeting, hereby caII upon the inhabitants of London and its environs, ] to come forward and aid their brethren of the North to rescue our noble friend and champion Stephens from the fangs of his and our oppressors. After all that has transpired through the press in relation to Mr. Stephens's arresl and comrit- ment, it weuld be superfluous for us to state why a Christian a minister distinguished by so many public end private virtues as t Mr. Stephens is known to have displayed throughout the whole of his politicalcareer, should have been placed in the situation I of an enemy of his country. It will suffice to say that he hrs been arrested either at the instigation, or with theconnivance I of the present Whig government, and is now awaiting his trial for the offence of making a speech. Six weeks beforehisarrest, 8 which was never reported, and of which the witnesses against him could only recollect a few disjointeg phrases and isolated C words, without their context, which, they say be uttered, and which are said to be illegal, those witnesses having, on their erose-exarninatlon, Satly contradicted themselves end each other. Under these circumstances we deem It wholly unneces Iary to argue Mr. Stephen's case, in this appeal, being convinced t that the w. Il-known character of the man is sufficient evidence f that he could not be guilty of the crimes laid to his charge, whilst the notorious character of his enemies, and the peculiar f circumstances of his arrest and commitment are not less con- clusive evidence that his prosecution Is the work of secret per- stonal malice and tyrannical injuslice-we shall, therefore i withoat further comment, leave the public to judge at once of I the motives of his oppressoss, and of the necessity that exitis for yielding him prompt and efficient succoor With respect to those who have hitherto known Mr. Stephens r only ihrough the misrepresentstons of his euemies, we feel bound, as Englishmen and Christlans, to call upon them to dismiss their prejudiesa, and to consult those who best know the maan before they condem him. By dolng so, they will leapn that he iseone of the best of husbanlds cnd fathersa, one of thce best of Christian ministers, and one of tbe best and bravest friends of humanity, peace, and order, that ever adorned this or any other country. Let theem but enquire, before they judge, and we feel assured that if they be good men and . Christians, they will soon be found amongst the most ardent of I his friends. They will accord him their sympathies, their prayers, and ais far as fortune has favoured them, those pecaet niary and other aid which may enable him to meet lbs lheavy expenses of a trial in Weetminler. ( more than 200 miles distant from the place of his alleged offence) and to dernonetratt his I rinnocence before a British ]ndge and jury. Stepbens is poor; .those wrho best knowr him are likewvise poor; his enemiiesI jare rich and powerful, and have shown to he also malignant. It they succeed iD crushing Stephens, their appetite for perse-4 cutionl will be whetted, they will bunt out new victims, andtheir rage, encouraged by success, will know nO respite, until every a other friend of humanity has been consigned either to a dungeon 1 orto Ignominin s silencel The causc of Stephens istherefore the causeof all-every good man, every rentaChritianeveryloverpf v justice-every sufferer from oppression is personally concerned in it. Hlscondemnation would practically operate to the con- demnation of our causc; his triumph will be in reality the s trtumph of twenty mIllions of onrepresented, oppressed, and injured people. Say, then, men of London, shaU this upright man be left alone in the hour of his need I Shall he be de. serted in the day of his persecution I We know your answer will be-\" NO, IT SHALL NOT BE ;\" .
